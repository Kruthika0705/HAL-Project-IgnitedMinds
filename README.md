This AI-based Food Waste Reduction project analyzes transaction data to identify food wastage patterns and provide actionable recommendations. The system processes sales data, cleans and formats it, and detects food items with high wastage. Based on insights, it suggests donation options or alternative uses for surplus food. The dataset includes transaction details such as product names, total items, cost, discounts, store type, and seasonality. The preprocessing pipeline ensures accurate date formatting, handles missing values, and standardizes categorical data. This project aims to minimize food waste by leveraging AI-driven analytics and recommendations.
